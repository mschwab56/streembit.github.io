title: Can terrorists use Streembit?
subtitle: The moral dilemma, should we stop designing open source software if terrorists and criminals use it?

What about terrorists, can they use Streembit? The reality is, terrorists can use all open source as well as proprietary software. The developers of Streembit are libertarians and certainly donâ€™t subscribe to terrorist agendas. Our values and what we believe in couldn't be farther from the murderous culture adopted by terrorists. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that terrorists and organized criminal gangs who can use our secure communication system can indeed pose a moral dilemma for a software developer who is designing such a secure communication system.  
  No one in their right mind can be happy if their software becomes the tool of killers, paedophiles, cyber criminals and drug traffickers. On the other hand, the reality is that terrorists and criminals use electricity, cars, mobile phones, drones and all other tools and modern innovations. Moreover, they even use weapons that are sold by Western and Russian governments. It make no sense, and it is certainly not fair to cherry pick technologies. Those that generate profit to corporations are available to terrorists and criminals, while others like open source software systems are banned. Right to privacy and private communication are both fundamental human rights. Benjamin Franklin said, ___"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety"___. We should keep innovating and creating novel systems for law abiding citizens and businesses, even if a few bad guys take advantage of the system.
